    nature = Modest / Timid
    moves = Growth / Sleep Powder, Giga Drain, Weather Ball, Sludge Bomb / Earth Power

    evs = 0, 0, 4, 252, 0, 252
    nature = Modest / Timid
    moves = Flamethrower / Heat Wave, Jetstream, Focus Blast / Solar Beam, Roost
    comment = Mega Charizard Y is hands down, the better Mega Charizard. Having a monsterous Sp. Attack stat along with Drought and good moves, it can wreak havoc on any team. In doubles, it can play a good support role to Chlorophyll users (such as Venusaur, Scovillain, etc). Charizard also gets Solar Beam to take out the Rock, Ground and Water types that would otherwise cause trouble. Roost gives Charizard longevity, letting it recover off Stealth Rock damage.

    nature = Timid
    moves = Shell Smash, Ice Beam, Bubble Beam / Scald, Flash Cannon 
    comment = Shell Smash already makes Blastoise a really strong sweeper. But without a White Herb, Blastoise will be very frail... Only if the enemy survives +2 Sp. Attack Mega Launcher boosted Bubble Beams, Ice Beams and Flash Cannon. Running this set under Metal Terrain will remove the stat drop problem, while also boosting Flash Cannon.
