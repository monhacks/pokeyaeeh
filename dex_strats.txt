Venusaur
{
    name = Sunflower
    item = Papaya Berry / Sitrus Berry
    ability = Chlorophyll
    evs = 4, 0, 0, 252, 0, 252
    nature = Modest / Timid
    moves = Growth / Sleep Powder, Giga Drain, Weather Ball, Sludge Bomb / Earth Power
    comment = Needs harsh sunlight to function. Good partners: Drought users such as Mega Charizard Y, Typhlosion, Sunflora, Groudon, Torkoal or Koraidon. 
    tags = Offensive, Sweeper, Support

Charizard Mega X
{ 
    name = Physical Sweeper
    item = Charizardite X
    ability = Tough Claws
    evs = 0, 252, 0, 0, 4, 252
    nature = Adamant / Jolly
    moves = Flare Blitz / Raging Fury, Dragon Rush / Dragon Claw / Outrage, Dragon Dance / Swords Dance, Earthquake / Supercell Slam / Roost
    comment = Charizard's kit was buffed to include new moves like Raging Fury (now a contact move), Knuckle Punch and Supercell Slam. Dragon Dance to improve Speed or Swords Dance to hit even harder. Additionally, it also has Roost for reliable recovery.

Charizard Mega Y
{ 
    name = Sun Sweeper
    item = Charizardite Y
    ability = Drought
    evs = 0, 0, 4, 252, 0, 252
    nature = Modest / Timid
    moves = Flamethrower / Heat Wave, Jetstream, Focus Blast / Solar Beam, Roost
    comment = Mega Charizard Y is hands down, the better Mega Charizard. Having a monsterous Sp. Attack stat along with Drought and good moves, it can wreak havoc on any team. In doubles, it can play a good support role to Chlorophyll users (such as Venusaur, Scovillain, etc). Charizard also gets Solar Beam to take out the Rock, Ground and Water types that would otherwise cause trouble. Roost gives Charizard longevity, letting it recover off Stealth Rock damage.

Blastoise Mega 
{
    name = Shell Smash Sweeper
    item = Blastoisinite
    ability = Mega Launcher
    evs = 0, 0, 4, 252, 0, 252
    nature = Timid
    moves = Shell Smash, Ice Beam, Bubble Beam / Scald, Flash Cannon 
    comment = Shell Smash already makes Blastoise a really strong sweeper. But without a White Herb, Blastoise will be very frail... Only if the enemy survives +2 Sp. Attack Mega Launcher boosted Bubble Beams, Ice Beams and Flash Cannon. Running this set under Metal Terrain will remove the stat drop problem, while also boosting Flash Cannon.

    moves = Aqua Cutter, Endure, Swords Dance, Rock Blast / Frost Blade
    comment = Endure Salac Berry Aqua Cutter shenanigans. They will not see this coming.

    evs = 0, 0, 4, 252, 0, 252
    nature = Modest
    moves = Draining Kiss, Giga Drain, Earth Power, Calm Mind
    comment = Triage provides +3 priority to healing moves, and Meganium can easily exploit that.

Typhlosion
{ 
    name = Scarfed Nuke
    item = Choice Scarf
    ability = Drought
    evs = 0, 0, 4, 252, 0, 252
    nature = Modest / Timid
    moves = Eruption / Heat Wave, Solar Beam, Earth Power / Scorching Sands, Focus Blast / Hidden Power [Fighting]
    comment = Basically a poor man's Mega Charizard Y. What it lacks in power, it has in Choice Scarf Eruption. One single move to blow all enemies that try to attack it... unless they are even fast or have Flash Fire or Well Baked Body.

    item = Loaded Dice
    ability = Technician
    evs = 0, 252, 0, 0, 4, 252
    nature = Adamant / Jolly
    moves = Bullet Seed, Scale Shot, Arm Thrust, Swords Dance
    comment = A little RNG-based, if not for Loaded Dice. Swords Dance set up and Scale Shot in case to up speed. Arm Thrust is coverage against pesky Steel-types tha resist Grass and Dragon-type attacks.

    nature = Adamant
    moves = Leaf Blade, Dual Chop, Sacred Sword / X-Scissor, Swords Dance / Dragon Dance
    comment = A reliable fast physical sweeper. Mega Sceptile does it nicely! Super fast, super strong, strong ability with good moves.

    evs = 0, 252, 4, 0, 0, 252
    nature = Adamant
    moves = Iron Head, Play Rough, Swords Dance, Sucker Punch
    comment = Physical sweeping Mawile set. Use Swords Dance to double the already massive Attack stat. EVs in speed can be swapped to bulk too. Mawile got a sweet Speed stat buff, so now you can run max Speed EVs, too.
