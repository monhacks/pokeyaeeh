Charizard Mega X
{ 
    name = Physical Sweeper
    item = Charizardite X
    ability = Tough Claws
    evs = 0, 252, 0, 0, 4, 252
    nature = Adamant / Jolly
    moves = Flare Blitz / Raging Fury, Dragon Rush / Dragon Claw / Outrage, Dragon Dance / Swords Dance, Earthquake / Supercell Slam / Roost
    comment = Charizard's kit was buffed to include new moves like Raging Fury (now a contact move), Knuckle Punch and Supercell Slam. Dragon Dance to improve Speed or Swords Dance to hit even harder. Additionally, it also has Roost for reliable recovery.
    tags = Physical Attacker, Offensive, Sweeper

Charizard Mega Y
{ 
    name = Sun Sweeper
    item = Charizardite Y
    ability = Drought
    evs = 0, 0, 4, 252, 0, 252
    nature = Modesy / Timid
    moves = Flamethrower / Heat Wave, Jetstream, Focus Blast / Solar Beam, Roost
    comment = Mega Charizard Y is hands down, the better Mega Charizard. Having a monsterous Sp. Attack stat along with Drought and good moves, it can wreak havoc on any team. In doubles, it can play a good support role to Chlorophyll users (such as Venusaur, Scovillain, etc). Charizard also gets Solar Beam to take out the Rock, Ground and Water types that would otherwise cause trouble. Roost gives Charizard longevity, letting it recover off Stealth Rock damage.

Mawile Mega
{ 
    name = Heavy Hitter
    item = Mawilite
    ability = Huge Power
    evs = 0, 252, 4, 0, 0, 252
    nature = Adamant
    moves = Iron Head, Play Rough, Swords Dance, Sucker Punch
    comment = Physical sweeping Mawile set. Use Swords Dance to double the already massive Attack stat. EVs in speed can be swapped to bulk too. Mawile got a sweet Speed stat buff, so now you can run max Speed EVs, too.
